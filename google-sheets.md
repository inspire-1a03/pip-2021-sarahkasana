#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->
Looking at the COVID-19 tests and vaccinations per 100 people in Ontario, while tests have increased very steadily since the beginning of the pandemic, vaccines (which began distribution earlier in 2021) are increasing at a might faster rate , despite not having as many vacciantions as tests. This may be due to the recent icnrease of supply of vaccinesand the fact that more Ontarians are more eligible for the vaccine now than when distribution started.
