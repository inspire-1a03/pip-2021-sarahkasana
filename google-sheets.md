#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->
As the figure shows, daily cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, increased and decreased synchronously since the beginning of the pandemic, with three major waves. One wave occured near the beginning of the pandemic, another spike near the beginning of 2021, and the third wave this past month in May, which seems to have crested and is steadily decreasing.

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->
Looking at the COVID-19 tests and vaccinations per 100 people in Ontario, while tests have increased very steadily since the beginning of the pandemic, vaccines (which began distribution earlier in 2021) are increasing at a might faster rate , despite not having as many vacciantions as tests. This may be due to the recent icnrease of supply of vaccinesand the fact that more Ontarians are more eligible for the vaccine now than when distribution started. 

## 3. Vaccination rates across provinces and territories
> Q3: How do vaccination rates over time compare between all provinces and territories?

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->
Vaccines became available in January, where we start to see rates increasing. Territories overall have vaccinated more per capite (of 100 people) than provinces, as shown in the figure above. Smaller, relative populations in territories may have made it easier for the supply to meet the demand, and allow for a faster distribution plan.

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->
Canada-wide data showed that transit stations, workplaces, retail, and recreation areas decreased in mobility overall from baseline values established for the period leading up to the pandemic, with transit stations being hit the hardest.. Residential areas saw a greater increase from baseline values, while the mobilities in parks increased heavily shortly after the pandemic started, and then decreased once fall arrived, but is increasing again as this summer approaches. 

## Final reflection
> What inferences can you make from the data you have explored and visualized? 
> What questions still exist about the trends and the data? What new questions has this process generated? 
> What additional information would you like to help answer these questions? 

<!-- Write a short response below-->
When trying to attribute changes in data, it becomes conclusive that a lot of the data explored can be measured by looking at govenrment policy through different periods of time. In Ontario vaccinations rates increased as more age groups became eligible, which came as vaccine supplies increased through demands created by the government.Mobility trends were impacted heavily by lockdowns, where stores had smaller capacities or were shut down, as the same goes for work places. This may have forced Canadians to one of their few options of entertainment outdoors, in parks where they can stay socially-distant, leading to an increase in mobility. 

All of this data has lead to further inquiry. 
How are vaccine rates per province combatting case rates/deaths/hospitalizations?  This information can be used to create more research on vaccine efficacy especially with different variants. How much of cases/deaths/hospitalization can be attributed to new variants?  Most of the data is measured over time, what occured in different time periods to affect changes in data (i.e. lockdowns, schools, etc.)?

Vaccine rates vs. hospitalizations/cases/deaths can be compared aleady, but more information about how many people have recieved at least one dose, or both rahter than how many vacciantions were given out, could create more accurate conclusions. Data would have to gathered for cases/hospitalizations/deaths of different variants in order to understand their effect.  Timelines of specific policies that directly affected mobility and therefore cases would also have to be obtained.
