#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->

Territories, overall, have significantly greater vaccination rates per capita (of 100) than provinces, which can be seen visually from darker colours. Provinces have relatively small differences in their vaccine rates in comparison to each other, with most averaging around 50 vaccinations per 100 people .

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->
All regions in the figure, for the most part, decrease and increase in mobility in recreational and retail areas at the same time for a given time period. Shortly after the beginning pandemic, all regions dropped in visits increasingly fast from the baseline values,  and then increased while approaching back to normal, baseline values over the next several months. Shortly after January, 2021, however, each region differs drastically in trends of visiting recreations and retail destinations, most likely attriuted to COVID-19 case and vaccine rates that differ from region to region.

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->
Shortly after the pandemic, visits to parks in Ontario surged to a peak of 175%, and as September approached, it decreased close to baseline value until March, 2021 where it has been increasing overall throughout spring.
## 4. Reflection 
> What are your initial thoughts about using Tableau vs. Google Sheets? What might be the advantages of each? 
> There is a comfortbaility to using Google Sheets as is it familiar and what I use most of the time to create figures. Google sheets is straight forward with a simple setup and has more resources to assist online when experiencing issues. However, that comes with limitations, and that is where Tableau has the advantage. Tableau allows you to filter and pick and sort through data in much more detail through subcategories, and allows you to exclude and experiment with different inputs and variables. It automatically recognizes and formats different types of data for you, with more graphs and charts than Google Sheets has to offer. 

> What inferences can you make from the Mobility data that you explored and visualized? 
> 
> What new questions would you like to ask of the data? 
> How might you use these two datasets together to perform new analyses?
