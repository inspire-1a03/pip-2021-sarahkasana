# Exercise 3: Advanced visualization using Tableau


## 1. Mapping regional vaccination rates
> Q1: What is the current state of vaccinations among provinces and territories?

<iframe seamless frameborder="0" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/skasana_vax_per_100_canada/Dashboard1?:embed=yes&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no" width = '650' height = '650' scrolling='no'></iframe> 

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->

Territories, overall, have significantly greater vaccination rates per capita (of 100) than provinces, which can be seen visually from darker colours. Provinces have relatively small differences in their vaccine rates in comparison to each other, with most averaging around 50 vaccinations per 100 people .

## 2. Changes in travel to retail and recreation destinations for provinces/territories
> Q2: How has travel to recreation and retail locations changed over time between regions of Canada?

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->
All regions in the figure, for the most part, decrease and increase in mobility in recreational and retail areas at the same time for a given time period. Shortly after the beginning pandemic, all regions dropped in visits increasingly fast from the baseline values,  and then increased while approaching back to normal, baseline values over the next several months. Shortly after January, 2021, however, each region differs drastically in trends of visiting recreations and retail destinations, most likely attriuted to COVID-19 case and vaccine rates that differ from region to region.

## 3. Changes in travel to parks for Ontario counties/municipalities
> Q3: How has travel to parks changed over time in Ontario's counties/municipalities?  

<!-- Paste your embed code for your figure below-->
<iframe seamless frameborder="0" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/changesinparksontario/Dashboard1?:embed=yes&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no" width = '650' height = '650' scrolling='no'></iframe> 

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->
Shortly after the pandemic, visits to parks in Ontario surged to a peak of 175%, and as September approached, it decreased close to baseline value until March, 2021 where it has been increasing overall throughout spring.
## 4. Reflection 
> What are your initial thoughts about using Tableau vs. Google Sheets? What might be the advantages of each? 

There is a comfortbaility to using Google Sheets as is it familiar and what I use most of the time to create figures. Google sheets is straight forward with a simple setup and has more resources to assist online when experiencing issues. However, that comes with limitations, and that is where Tableau has the advantage. Tableau allows you to filter and pick and sort through data in much more detail through subcategories, and allows you to exclude and experiment with different inputs and variables. It automatically recognizes and formats different types of data for you, with more graphs and charts than Google Sheets has to offer. 

> What inferences can you make from the Mobility data that you explored and visualized? 

When looking at nationwide data for retail and recreational destinations specifically, it can be inferred that the drop of mobility initially at the beginning of the pandmeic can be due to either the public choosing to limit non-essential travel or a combination of this with policies that restricted a lot of non-essential retail and recreational areas at this time. As time went on restrictions loosened which lead to the percentage of mobility approaching abseline values nation-wide, and after January, 2021, with differing success rates in vaccines and lowering case counts of COVID-19, there are different levels of visitation in these areas. 

In regards to parks, as mentioned before, the surge in visitation is oikely due to the fact that after restrictions and being conscious of social-distancing, parks are one of the few ways for the public to have fun while maintaining distance form other groups of people as it is out in the public, and were  exempt most of the time from different stages of lockdowns (other than playgrounds). Seasonal weather may have had an effect on the decline later in 2020, but as Spring is here once again, we see mobility increasing once again.


> What new questions would you like to ask of the data? 

How can this data be used by public health agencies to limit the spread of COVID-19? How can the factors leading to surges and decreases in visitation be determined? How much of visitation to these areas affect the spread of COVID-19 (is it importnat to look at visitation in these areas)?

> How might you use these two datasets together to perform new analyses? 

By comparing datasets of different areas on the same graph, you are able to gather an idea of overall mobility in the region over time rather than distinct destinations. By comparing mobility in different destinations, it can also help determine which areas are being visited more or less, and if the pandemic had an effect of them, which can help determine what areas need to be looked at when creating restrictions and lockdowns more effectively.
