#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->Focusing on when vaccine counts start, although from March through of of April, 2021, daily new cases and vaccinations increase, there comes a turning point near the beginning of May where the change in counts decrease as more vaccinations are given to the population. This may imply a correlation where vaccines are helping curb the spread of COVID-19 as more populations become eligble to recieve it, shwoing the efficacy of vaccines nation-wide.
