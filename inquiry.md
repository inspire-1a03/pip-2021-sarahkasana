#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->Focusing on when vaccine counts start, although from March through of of April, 2021, daily new cases and vaccinations increase, there comes a turning point near the beginning of May where the change in counts decrease as more vaccinations are given to the population. This may imply a correlation where vaccines are helping curb the spread of COVID-19 as more populations become eligble to recieve it, shwoing the efficacy of vaccines nation-wide.

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->
I was interested in transit stations becasue despite some temporary closures of different stations in various regions of different provinces, moste were up and running without too many restrictions imposed unlike other destinations such as retail.I wanted to see if there was a drop in demand from the public as a result of the pandemic. 

According to the figure, transit mobility in 4 of the most populous provinces saw a steep decrease from baseline levels when the pandemic began, and although increased eventually, it never recovered to baseline levels.This may indicate concerns from the public of hygriene, spreading COVID-19 and a lack of social distancing in already-busy transit stations. Despite being integral to so many people in order to get through their day, transit stations still saw a drop in demand due to lack of care in stopping the spread of COVID-19.
